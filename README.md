## Ruby and Rails Versions:
- `Ruby 3.0.2`
- `Rails 6.1.4`
## How to use it  :

- Clon the project to your machine using the command:
````bash
git clone git@github.com:smaily1/blog.git
````
- Change the directory to the project by typing `cd blog` than install the gems by typing :
````bash
bundle install
````
- Migration step and creating tabels in your database :
````bash
rails db:migrate
````

- Finally run the server by typing the command :
````bash
> rails server 
````
you will find your app working at `http://localhost:3000`

## Notes :
I know that the design of the blog is bad, I am trying to develop myself in this aspect now
> Any other suggestions I would be happy to add to the application. Thank you.
